                <h2>A Lifelong Educator with Heart</h2>
                <p class="lead mb-4">Rosemary Jenkins dedicated her life to shaping the minds and hearts of young learners, building a legacy as an educator that continues to echo through the lives of her students, colleagues, and the educators she mentored.</p>
                
                <h3>Academic Foundation</h3>
                <p>She began her journey at the <strong>University of Northern Iowa</strong>, where she earned her <strong>Bachelor's Degree in Education</strong> in 1972 and became a proud member of <strong>Pi Gamma Mu</strong>, the international honor society in the social sciences. Her time at UNI not only equipped her with strong academic preparation but also fostered the values of service, leadership, and lifelong learning.</p>

                <p>Committed to continuous learning, Rosemary later earned her <strong>Master's Degree in Education from National Louis University</strong> in 1999, further enhancing her ability to create impactful learning experiences for her students.</p>

                <h3>Early Career</h3>
                <p>Her teaching career began in <strong>Davenport, Iowa</strong>, where she taught <strong>4th grade at Davenport Elementary School</strong>. From her very first classroom, Rosemary stood out for her creativity, dedication, and belief in every child's potential.</p>

                <h3>Florida Legacy</h3>
                <p>In <strong>1985</strong>, Rosemary and her family moved to <strong>Florida</strong>, where she began teaching at <strong>Northwest Elementary School</strong> in Hudson. Over the next two decades, she became a cornerstone of the school community. During her tenure, she played a key role in <strong>developing curriculum to support effective teaching practices for elementary students</strong>, helping shape the instructional methods used throughout the district. Her impact was formally recognized in <strong>2004</strong>, when she was named <strong>Pasco County Teacher of the Year</strong>.</p>

                <p>Rosemary later taught <strong>2nd grade at Cypress Elementary School</strong>, continuing to bring joy and inspiration to her students. Beyond her classroom, she extended her guidance to the next generation of educators by serving as a <strong>mentor to graduate students and teaching interns from the University of South Florida's College of Education</strong>.</p>

                <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
                <p>More than her credentials and awards, it was Rosemary's teaching philosophy that defined her legacy:</p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled mb-4">
                    <li class="mb-2">✨ <em>Every child can learn</em></li>
                    <li class="mb-2">🎨 <em>Creativity in education is essential</em></li>
                    <li class="mb-2">🌱 <em>Growth mindset should be nurtured daily</em></li>
                    <li class="mb-2">💫 <em>Confidence-building opens doors students didn't know existed</em></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Her classroom was a space of encouragement, curiosity, and belief—a place where students were not only taught but truly seen and supported. Rosemary's lifelong devotion to education left a lasting mark on every child she taught and every teacher she inspired.</p>
