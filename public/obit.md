# Rosemary Desotel Jenkins
## October 27, 1949 – February 10, 2025

Rosemary Jenkins, 75, of Central City, Iowa, passed away peacefully on February 10, 2025. Born on October 27, 1949, to Bob and Kate Desotel (both deceased), Rosemary grew up in Central City, Iowa, surrounded by a loving family. She was a cherished sister to Shirley (Linc) Champagne, Kay (Brad) Clark, Mike (Tonda) Desotel, and the late John (Susan) Desotel.

Rosemary dedicated her life to education, earning a Bachelor's degree in Arts from the University of Northern Iowa and a Master's degree in Education from National Louis University. Her teaching career spanned over 32 years, touching countless young lives at elementary schools in Davenport Iowa, Hudson Florida (Northwest Elem), and Cypress Elementary in New Port Richey, Florida.

She was a devoted mother to her three sons, Doug (Sarah) Jenkins, Daniel (Danielle) Jenkins, and Mark Jenkins. Her love and pride extended to her treasured grandchildren: Alina, Keegan, Ashley, Emma, Lillian, Katherine, Charlotte, and Christopher.

Rosemary embraced life with an adventurous and warm spirit, finding joy from the rolling prairies of home in Iowa, to the peaceful mountain views of Colorado, and the bright sunny skies of Florida. Above all, she found purpose in her family—her sons, siblings, and grandchildren were the center of her world.

She will be deeply missed and forever remembered for her kind heart, unwavering dedication to education, and boundless love for her family.

A memorial service to honor Rosemary's life will be held at Cedar Memorial on Saturday, June 28, 2025 in Cedar Rapids.
